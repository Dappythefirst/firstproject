      <h4>Short Description</h4>

    <p>Verena and Linn's older brother. He is a guard so he mainly deals with/captures monsters, but also just makes sure that people are safe in general. Because he reported Dainan he accitentaly got Linn captured and thought she had been exicuted. Ammon normaly lives alone but allowed Maverick to stay at his house until he found a propper place for him to stay; the two end up forming a sibling-like bond.</p>

When they were initaly discovered he hid at Verena's house with Luken, though all three of them end up getting captured later.</p>
